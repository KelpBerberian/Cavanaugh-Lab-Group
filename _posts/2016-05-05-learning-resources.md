#The beauty of computer programming is that you do not need to formally go to school to learn how to program. #You can learn almost everything that you would need to know online, and for free. The following resources are #some that I have used personally, that I highly recommend, for anyone looking to learn more about computer #programming.

# [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

#My personal favourite for learning full stack web development. They offer a great front and back end curriculum #that requires you to complete a variety of projects in order to apply the knowledge that you learn during the #lessons. As a bonus, at the end of the curriculum you will have a few impressive projects under your belt for #your portfolio.
